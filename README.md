# Processor-Design-project

Used Verilog, a hardware description language(HDL), to program a FPGA board to emulate a 5 stage pipelined processor with GPU support.

This ISA handles branch, store, and all form of ADD instruction set.

lg_highlevel.qar is the backup file that can be open using Quartus II to view the entire verilog code.

The sum.s file contains the Assembly code and the sum.hex contains the hex version; these are used for testing on the FPGA board.
